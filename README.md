# Module Calculator
This Module Calculator is to help Lerato to organise her life better
This is part 2 of the project where the data is stored into a database
### Introduction
The program will have to be able to store which modules a student is doing. Every module is
worth a specific number of credits. And that number multiplied by ten will be the number of
hours spent on it throughout the semester
